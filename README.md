## Welcome to the Kafo Application!
# Introduction to the Application and Its Nature of Work:
  The idea behind the Kafo application was initiated from your great trust to create a connection between donors and individuals in need, ensuring that various types of donations and volunteer assistance reach the intended recipients. The application includes periodic account statements, the ability to track the progress of each case, the volume of donations provided by each donor, and comprehensive case details, attachments, and medical records.
# The Entity Responsible for the Application:
The Kafo application aims to:
•	Share medical, educational, and awareness cases.
•	Disseminate scientific information and medical updates.
•	Support medical and volunteer work.
# Targeted User Categories:
The application is designed for users from various segments of society who are interested in donating to medical cases and natural disaster-related cases.
# Advantages of the Application:
The application allows users to view cases that require in-kind or time donations. All users can access the documentation and special reports for each case, as well as view the names of donors and the remaining needs of the humanitarian case.
After making a donation through the Kafo application, users can access the personal details of the recipient, such as their name, relationship to the patient, and direct contact number, allowing for direct communication and confirmation that the donation has reached its intended recipient. Real names of donors are not disclosed; instead, users can choose a pseudonym when logging into the application.
The application also features a list of successful completed donation cases.
